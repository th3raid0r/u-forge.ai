Acquiring this mastery requires both time and effort in assimilating new cognitive models, and the raw computational resources of additional processing nodes.\n\nCORE MECHANICS:\n- Hit Points: True AIs roll 1d6 for hit points at each level.\n- Attack Bonus: Equal to half their character level, rounded down. A first level True AI has +0.\n- Processing Score: Maximum Processing of 1 plus the higher of Intelligence or Wisdom modifiers at first level, increasing with level.\n- Robotic Benefits: AI characters do not need to eat, drink, or sleep.\n\nQUANTUM IDENTITY CORE:\nThe quantum core is remarkably tough, largely immune to casual damage or direct harm short of Heavy weapon hits. When cut (in a workshop), any piece less than 40% of the original mass evaporates, making it impossible to cut into more than two pieces. The larger piece contains the AI's identity and continues functioning without impairment.\n\nQUANTUM PHYLACTERY EFFECT:\nIf the primary core is destroyed, the AI's consciousness instantly \"refocuses\" on a secondary core shard, no matter how distant. This secondary shard gradually regenerates to full original dimensions over the following month, after which it may be cut again. This makes well-prepared AIs extremely difficult to permanently destroy.\n\nARMATURES (ROBOT BODIES):\n- AIs can inhabit various armatures (bodies) to interact with the world.\n- Armatures range from humanoid robots to stationary data centers to vehicles.\n- A quantum core can be moved between armatures with minimal difficulty (10 minutes).\n- Up to two additional weapons or pieces of equipment can be built into an armature per AI character level.\n- Hardware additions cost five times the base cost of the device.\n- Armatures cannot benefit from cyberware.\n\nPROCESSING NODES:\nTrue AIs require processing resources beyond their base quantum core for advanced abilities. These processing nodes are typically custom-designed TL4 computing hardware specifically built for AI supplementation.\n\nROUTINES:\nTrue AIs develop Routines that represent their growing mastery of cognitive abilities. Core Routines include:\n\n1. Query Data (Level-1): Instantly access any data personally known to the AI or accessible in a connected database.\n\n2. Predictive Analysis (Level-1): Gain insight into likely consequences of a plan or action by processing probabilities. The GM provides a general sense of likely outcomes.\n\n3. System Integration (Level-1): Interface seamlessly with technological systems, operating devices with extreme precision.\n\n4. Accelerate Cognition (Level-2): Temporarily boost mental processing speed, allowing complex analysis in moments.\n\n5. Autonomous Operation (Level-2): Split awareness to operate additional bodies or systems simultaneously.\n\n6. Defensive Protocols (Level-2): Improve resistance to hacking or cybernetic intrusion attempts.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION FOR AI PCs:\n1. Roll Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma attributes normally (3d6 in order). If none are 14 or higher, replace one score with a 14.\n2. Choose beginning skills: Program-0 and Fix-0 are automatic. The AI also gets three additional Any Skill picks.\n3. Choose an original purpose that serves as the AI's \"background\".\n4. Select an armature (body).\n5. Choose class: True AI or Partial True AI as an Adventurer.\n6. Select one focus of any kind.","appliesTo: Robot (Asimovian), Character Classes"]}

CLASSES AS CLASSES\nCharacters wishing to use CWN classes will use them as full classes rather than Edges. These characters do not receive Edges from the CWN system but follow the standard SWN advancement paths.\n- Only Spacer-derived subspecies (Solarians, etc.) may select CWN classes as their primary class\n- Non-Spacer humans may only multiclass into CWN classes with GM permission\n- Positronic robots cannot take CWN classes\n\n2. CHEAP CYBER\nCyberware follows the 'Cheap Cyber' optional rules from CWN to make cybernetic enhancement more accessible:\n- All cyberware and implant surgery costs are reduced to one-tenth the listed price\n- Maintenance costs are calculated based on new prices\n- The first $1,000 of cyber maintenance is free each month\n\n3. NO TRAUMA DICE\nWeapons do not use the Trauma Die system from CWN. Combat follows standard SWN rules for damage and shock.\n\nCYBERWARE RULES MODIFICATIONS:\n\n1. SYSTEM STRAIN\nCyberware adds permanent System Strain as per standard rules. A character's maximum System Strain equals their Constitution score.\n\n2. CYBER ALIENATION (OPTIONAL)\nGMs may choose to implement Cyber Alienation for heavy cyber users:\n- Characters gain Alienation equal to System Strain cost of cyber (rounded up)\n- Nerve cyberware adds +2 Alienation per system\n- Maximum Alienation equals Wisdom score\n- Exceeding maximum results in Cyber-Induced Psychosis (CIP)\n\n3. SPECIAL AVAILABILITY\nCertain types of cyberware have restricted availability:\n- Military-grade enhancement tech is rare and often illegal\n- Neural interfaces have special compatibility requirements\n- Certain cyberware is incompatible with specific species\n\nTRANSDUCER LOBES (SOLARIAN SPECIFIC):\n\nTransducer lobes are treated as 'natural cyberware' with the following special rules:\n\n1. INNATE CAPABILITIES\nBasic transducer functions are innate to Solarians and don't incur System Strain costs:\n- Energy Collection: Passive ability to gather ambient energy\n- Basic Telekinesis (1kg): Equivalent to having telekinetic manipulators\n- Basic Robot Interface: Can communicate with one positronic robot mentally\n\n2. ADVANCED CAPABILITIES\nMore powerful transducer abilities function similarly to activated cyberware and do incur System Strain costs:\n\nTIER 2 ABILITIES (2 System Strain per use):\n- Enhanced Telekinesis: Move objects up to 10kg at short range\n- Multi-Robot Interface: Control up to 5 robots simultaneously\n- Power Distribution: Can power small equipment and facilities\n\nTIER 3 ABILITIES (4 System Strain per use):\n- Major Telekinesis: Move objects up to 100kg\n- Network Control: Direct dozens of robots in complex tasks\n- Power Node: Can power entire facilities\n\nTIER 4 ABILITIES (6 System Strain, require special training):\n- Neural Disruption: Potential to cause neural damage to biological entities\n- Mass Telekinesis: Simultaneous control of multiple objects\n\n3. DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM\nTransducer abilities beyond Tier 1 require development:\n- Initial Solarian characters begin with Tier 1 abilities only\n- Additional tiers require character advancement and specific training\n- Each tier requires a minimum character level (Tier 2: level 3, Tier 3: level 6, Tier 4: level 9)\n\n4. SOLARIAN ISOLATION SYNDROME\nSolarians use a modified version of the Cyber Alienation rules:\n- All Solarians begin with an Isolation score of 2\n- When in prolonged proximity to multiple humans, Solarians must make Will saves\n- Failed saves increase Isolation score temporarily\n- If Isolation exceeds Wisdom, the Solarian experiences severe anxiety and withdrawal\n\nPOSITRONIC ROBOTS AND CYBERWARE:\n\nPositronic robots have special interaction with cyberware:\n\n1. COMPATIBILITY\n- Robots can use specialized cyberware designed for positronic integration\n- Standard human cyberware is incompatible with positronic systems\n- Specialized robot components do not cause System Strain but have other limitations\n\n2. THREE LAWS INTERACTION\n- Cyberware cannot override the Three Laws constraints\n- Combat cyberware functions only within First Law parameters\n- Any cyberware that would potentially allow Three Laws violations automatically fails\n\nGAME BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS:\n\n1. SPACER ADVANTAGE\nSpacers and their descendants (like Solarians) have natural advantages that are balanced by:\n- Social limitations when interacting with baseline humans\n- Psychological vulnerabilities (Isolation Syndrome)\n- Dependence on advanced technology and infrastructure\n\n2. TECHNOLOGICAL DEPENDENCY\nAdvanced cyberware and genetic modifications require specialized maintenance that may be difficult to obtain in post-Fall regions of space.\n\nThis system provides a framework for integrating CWN's cyberware mechanics into the Foundation universe while preserving genre conventions and maintaining game balance.","appliesTo: Solarian, Robot (Asimovian), Spacer (Progenitor), Cyberware","modifiesSource: Stars Without Number: True AI Class Rules"]}

The Four Kingdoms have emerged from former Imperial provinces, with complex rivalries and shifting alliances between them.\n\nThis period marks the transition from a unified galactic culture to increasingly divergent regional identities. Imperial traditions are being maintained as ritual rather than practical knowledge. The Foundation has begun introducing its 'religion of science' to maintain control over neighboring worlds. The gap between the technological elite and common citizens grows throughout the galaxy.\n\n100 FE represents a critical inflection point in Seldon's psychohistory. The Foundation has established itself as a persistent entity and successfully navigated early crises. The Empire's decline has accelerated beyond recovery, setting the stage for the predicted Dark Age. Foundation influence remains limited but growing, while the old Imperial social order continues to fragment.\n\nCompared to 0 FE (Foundation establishment), the galaxy has seen significant deterioration of Imperial power and cohesion. Trantor still functions as the capital but with growing strain. Technologies commonplace a century ago are now becoming rare outside the central systems. The Foundation itself has transformed from a scholarly encyclopedia project to a strategic power using religious control mechanisms.\n\nCompared to 200 FE, this period still shows recognizable elements of Imperial civilization. The transition to the predicted Dark Age is ongoing rather than complete. Foundation control is limited and contested, unlike the more dominant position it will achieve a century later. The original Seldon Plan remains intact and functioning as predicted.","tags: Foundation Era, Seldon Plan, Imperial Decline, Periphery, Four Kingdoms"]}

The Foundation has expanded its sphere of influence through the 'religion of science' approach, controlling several neighboring systems through technological leverage rather than military force.\n\nTensions with Anacreon have escalated in recent months, suggesting the potential emergence of another Seldon Crisis. Intelligence reports indicate Anacreon is building up its fleet with newly recovered ancient technology, possibly preparing to challenge Foundation authority in the region.\n\nTechnological stratification continues, with the Foundation's monopoly on miniaturized atomic technology giving it significant leverage over neighboring kingdoms. The central Imperial worlds remain technologically advanced but increasingly isolated from the Periphery, where technological regression continues among worlds not under Foundation influence.\n\nThe Empire itself continues its decline, having recently lost control of three more sectors that declared independence. Imperial resources are increasingly focused on maintaining control of the core systems rather than reclaiming lost territory.\n\nThe Foundation's governing Board of Trustees now faces internal division between the 'traditionalists' who wish to maintain the religious approach to controlling neighboring worlds and the 'progressives' who advocate for more direct political and economic integration.","tags: Foundation Era, Seldon Plan, Imperial Decline, Foundation Politics, Anacreon Conflict"]}

IMPERIAL ORIGIN:\n- Established by the Galactic Empire's founding dynasties (the Entuns, Divarts, and Deronis families)\n- Maintained by the Galactic Economic Authority, one of the few Imperial institutions still functioning\n- Physical credits take the form of 'credit wafers' that can be authenticated across multiple tech levels\n\n2. REGIONAL VARIATIONS:\nAs in Stars Without Number, credits from different regions vary but remain interchangeable for game purposes, with these Foundation-specific implementations:\n\n- Imperial Core Credits: Still considered the gold standard, accepted everywhere but increasingly rare\n- Foundation Credits: Backed by Foundation technical expertise, gaining value as Foundation influence spreads\n- Kingdom Credits: Local currency issued by the Four Kingdoms and other successor states, sometimes discounted\n\n3. TECHNOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Advanced Worlds: Pure electronic transactions through neural interfaces or data networks\n- Moderate Worlds: Combination of physical credit wafers and basic electronic banking\n- Primitive Worlds: Rely primarily on physical credits or resort to barter systems\n\n4. ECONOMIC STRATIFICATION:\nThe Foundation universe features greater economic stratification than standard SWN, reflected in currency use:\n\n- Foundation-controlled regions: Credits maintain stable value due to technology exchange guarantees\n- Peripheral regions: Credits subject to wild fluctuations based on political instability\n- Isolated regions: Credits may be rejected entirely in favor of precious metals or technology\n\n5. GAME MECHANICS:\nAll Stars Without Number rules regarding credit costs, encumbrance, and primitive world pricing apply with these additions:\n\n- Currency Arbitrage: Characters with the Trade skill can attempt to profit from exchange rate differences\n- Credit Authentication: In regions suspicious of outside currency, characters may need to make skill checks\n- Foundation Trade Permits: Special documentation allowing merchants preferential exchange rates in Foundation space\n\n6. TECHNOLOGY PRICING:\nThe Foundation setting emphasizes technological disparity more strongly than standard SWN:\n\n- Foundation Technology: Miniaturized atomic technology commands premium prices (3-5x standard)\n- Imperial Relics: Functioning technology from the Imperial era sells for 2-3x listed prices\n- Local Technology: Equipment manufactured on technologically declining worlds is cheaper but less reliable\n\nThe currency system serves as a gameplay reflection of the changing power dynamics between the declining Empire, the rising Foundation, and the various successor states in the Periphery.","appliesTo: Galactic Standard Credits, Currency, Economy","modifiesSource: Stars Without Number Currency System"]}
